<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Leander! I'm a queer disabled programmer and friend to wombats.</p>

<p>When I'm not studying programming, I'm usually writing, or playing video games or D&D.</p>

<p>My big project at the moment is Spoon Wizards, a task tracker for disabled people. I'm currently working on learning enough to change it from a toy app written in JQuery to something backed by a modern web framework and database, so that user data can persist across sessions</p>
